## Dataset used

[Nutritional values for common foods and products (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trolukovich/nutritional-values-for-common-foods-and-products)

## Preprocessing of data

I did initial data cleaning in the jupyter notebook ***'data_cleaning.ipynb'*** which generates a cleaned dataframe and saves it as ***'to_analyze.csv'*** in data folder.

After that I copied all the cleaning operations done in notebook to ***'data_cleaning.py'*** script and added one more operation to output another dataframe with string values to be displayed on the frontend. I saved the second dataframe as ***'for_app.csv'***.

Now ***'data_cleaning.py'*** takes the ***'nutrition.csv'*** and outputs both ***'to_analyze.csv'*** and ***'for_app.csv'*** in data folder.
